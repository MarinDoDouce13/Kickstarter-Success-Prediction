Kickstarter Success Prediction
This repository contains a project that predicts whether a Kickstarter campaign will successfully reach its fundraising goal. The analysis is conducted using exploratory data analysis (EDA), an artificial neural network (ANN) for classification, and clustering using DBSCAN.

Data and Project:
The data refers to a varaiety of crowdfunded project on the Kickstarter platform between 2017 and 2024.
This project comes from an assignement where we were tasked to predict which of the kickstarter projects would fail or succeed, and then conduct cluster analysis. 
We were tasked with using data which would be available on the lauch of the project for the prediciton task, whilst the cluster analysis would be performed on the whole of the dataset.

Project Structure:
- Notebook 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) \
  Analyzes key variables influencing campaign success.\
  Visualizes trends and distributions to identify important factors.\
  Transform and engineer different varaibles to gain more insight.

- Notebook 2: ANN Model Training and Cluster Analysis \
  Preprocesses data and prepares inputs for the model. \
  Trains an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify projects as successful or failed. \
  Evaluates model performance to assess predictive accuracy. \
  Cluster the kickstarter projects (DBSCAN). \
  Evaluate the cluster quality. \
  Get insights from the different clusters.
  

Goals: 
Understand the factors impacting Kickstarter success.
Build a predictive model to classify campaigns.
Understand what are the differences and similarities between different groups of projects.
